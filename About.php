ABOUT NO FOOD WASTE:</li>
<li>  No Food Waste is a Not-for-profit Organization started in  CUSAT kochi 
 with the vision of reducing and managing food waste and with
the vision of making the “World Hunger-Free”.</li>
<li>We are an edible food recovery and food waste management organization recovering
the surplus untouched excess foods from weddings, parties and other events and feeding the
hungry and needy people through dedicated food recovery vehicles, vessels, Helpline number
and mobile application connected by Standard Operating Procedures.</li>
<li>As food waste is becoming a global concern, we are working in alignment with the
United Nations (U.N) Sustainable Development Goals (MDG) of eliminating hunger and
poverty.</li>
<li>Along with food collection and distribution, we are creating awareness in
communities, educational institutions about "Food Waste" with support from like-minded
volunteers to sensitize people about the importance and value of food.</li>


WHY IS FOOD RECOVERY IMPORTANT?
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year
approximately 1.3 billion tonnes gets lost or wasted. Food losses and waste amounts to
roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing
countries.</li>
<li>
 Throwing away the edible food benefits no one. Not only could the food have gone to
someone in need, but the resource cost is tremendous. Our platform simplifies the
process of food recovery, so Donors can make social, environmental and financial
change in their choice to feed the needy.

      <p>Nearly all food waste go directly to the trash can or garbage disposal; a practice that is essentially wasteful especially considering that these products can be turned into something really useful: fertilizer.</p>

        <p>Food waste is one of the least recovered materials in the municipal solid waste stream and is one of the most important materials to divert from landfills. Food wastes are commonly generated in homes, institutions (e.g.schools, prisons, sport camps, religious camps, industries e.t.c), restaurants,etc. and these wastes must be removed to provide a clean and healthy environment.</br>
Food waste that is disposed of in landfills decomposes to create methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. It could be regarded as pure streams of waste and they constitute a major burden to the environment such as odor emanation, vermin attraction, toxic gas emission and groundwater contamination.</p>
